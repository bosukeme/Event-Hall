## Introduction
Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code that are stored on blockchain networks.

Smart contracts are written with solidity. <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.24/">Solidity</a> is an object-oriented, high-level programming language. It is a curly-bracket language designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types, among other features.
